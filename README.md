# CHANGELOGS
## Show changelogs of module in a non intrusive way.

# Why?

Module developers have no way of issuing changelogs or important warnings in a clean and streamlined way. This module adds a non intrusive way for users to get important informations.

# How does it work?

You can chose the level of importance you want to see
